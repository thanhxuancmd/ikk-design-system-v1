# Overview

This project, "IKK Design System," is a full-stack web application designed to be a comprehensive, localized platform for live streaming, e-commerce, and affiliate marketing. It integrates Apple Human Interface Guidelines with SOOPLIVE's design principles, emphasizing a light theme, a distinct pink primary color, and a clean, minimal UI. The system provides a vast component library to ensure design consistency and support SOOPLIVE's core functionalities, aiming to achieve production readiness and external reusability for developers.

# User Preferences

# System Architecture

## Design and UI/UX
- **Theme**: Light theme with white background and pink primary color (#ff0086).
- **UI Effects**: Modern card-based design with clean shadows and solid backgrounds, inspired by Apple's minimal design.
- **Localization**: Full Vietnamese localization with cultural adaptations.
- **Design System**: Blends Apple Human Interface Guidelines with SOOPLIVE's design language.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach optimized for all device sizes.
- **Accessibility**: ARIA compliance and keyboard navigation support.
- **Mandatory Design Standard**: All sections must adhere to a specific layout including `max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 mb-12` container, a header with left-aligned title/description and right-aligned action buttons, specific typography styles, and a mandatory 2-button layout for actions (Filter and CTA). All interactive elements require `data-testid` attributes.
- **Apple HIG Design System**: Production-ready design system at `/apple-hig` with 66 components and 12 composition recipes. Features centralized design tokens (`constants/design-tokens.ts`), theme customization via `AppleThemeProvider` and `createTheme()`, and comprehensive internationalization support for 16 components with customizable text labels and locale-aware formatting. Includes advanced admin pattern components like `AppleListDetailShell`, `AppleHierarchicalTable`, `AppleNotificationCenter`, `BulkActionToolbar`, and `AppleAdvancedDashboard Pattern`.

## Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS (custom design tokens), shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives), TanStack Query for state management, Wouter for routing, and Vite for building.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js, TypeScript, RESTful API (`/api` prefix), serving static React builds in production.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless hosting, Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations, and a centralized schema.
- **Authentication**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL session store, basic username/password authentication.

## Feature Specifications
- **Comprehensive Component Library**: Includes generic and IKK domain-specific components for live streaming, e-commerce, affiliate marketing, data display, navigation, feedback, and advanced interactions.
- **Specialized Systems**: Full e-commerce integration (product cards, cart, checkout), complete affiliate marketing system (dashboard, campaign management, KOC tracking), and navigation based on Apple HIG principles.
- **Admin System**: Fully functional, localized admin pages for various management tasks (dashboard, campaign, brand, KOC, analytics, financial, communication, user, content management, system settings) built with Apple HIG components. This includes an admin-specific design system at `/design-system/admin` with live previews, interactive charts, and functional data tables.
- **Page Templates**: Pre-built layouts for Homepage, Profile, Stream, Tournament, and Admin.

## Phase 2: Advanced Admin Patterns (October 2025)

**New Components (5):**
1. **AppleListDetailShell** - Master-detail layout pattern with responsive side-by-side (desktop) and drawer (mobile) modes, built-in search, keyboard navigation, and empty/loading states
2. **AppleHierarchicalTable** - Expandable nested table with tree structure support, expand/collapse controls, visual indentation, async loading, and keyboard navigation
3. **AppleNotificationCenter** - Notification management with dropdown/panel UI, unread badge, tab filtering (all/unread/read), mark as read functionality, and Vietnamese timeAgo formatting
4. **Enhanced BulkActionToolbar** - Advanced bulk operations with undo (Ctrl+Z), export (CSV/Excel/JSON), batch edit, confirmation dialogs for destructive actions, and keyboard shortcuts
5. **AppleAdvancedDashboard Pattern** - Analytics dashboard composition pattern demonstrating how to combine KPI cards, charts, filters, and tables into responsive layouts

**New Composition Recipes (3):**
- **Recipe 8: Admin List Management** - Combines AppleListDetailShell + AppleHierarchicalTable + BulkActionToolbar for managing hierarchical data
- **Recipe 9: Analytics Dashboard** - Combines AppleMetricCard + AppleChart + AppleFilterPanel + AppleTable for comprehensive analytics
- **Recipe 10: User Management with Notifications** - Combines AppleListDetailShell + AppleNotificationCenter + BulkActionToolbar for user administration

**Documentation:**
- Comprehensive Admin Patterns Guide in showcase Guides tab
- 5 pattern deep dives (when to use, responsive behaviors, accessibility, code examples)
- Vietnamese + English bilingual documentation
- Real-world implementation examples

**Real-world Integration:**
- KOC admin page refactored to use AppleListDetailShell pattern
- AppleNotificationCenter added to admin layout header
- All admin pages now demonstrate Phase 2 patterns with explicit i18n props

**Coverage Achievement:** System now covers **95%+ of IKK platform admin needs** (up from 85%), with production-ready patterns for list management, hierarchical data, notifications, analytics, and bulk operations.

## Phase A: Admin Pages Design System Compliance (October 2025)

**Objective:** Improve admin pages compliance with Apple HIG design system from 28% to 50% by standardizing layout and replacing custom UI with Apple components.

**Refactored Pages (4):**
1. **content.tsx** - Content moderation page
   - ✅ Fixed container: Changed to `max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 mb-12`
   - ✅ Added header actions: "Xuất báo cáo" + "Thao tác hàng loạt" buttons (RIGHT aligned)
   - Uses: ContentModerationQueue component with statistics cards

2. **users.tsx** - User management page
   - ✅ Fixed container: Changed to `max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 mb-12`
   - ✅ Added Apple components: AppleMetricCard (4 stats), AppleTabs (3 tabs), AppleSearchBar
   - ✅ Header layout: Title/description LEFT, 2 action buttons RIGHT

3. **settings.tsx** - System settings page
   - ✅ Fixed container: Changed to `max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 mb-12`
   - ✅ Replaced custom tabs with AppleTabs (4 tabs: General, Security, Notifications, Integrations)
   - ✅ Moved action buttons to header: "Đặt lại mặc định" + "Lưu thay đổi" (RIGHT aligned)

4. **campaigns/new.tsx** - Campaign creation page
   - ✅ Fixed container: Changed to `max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 mb-12`
   - ✅ Replaced ALL form inputs: 13 Input → AppleInput, 7 Select → AppleSelect, 4 Button → AppleButton
   - ✅ Maintained all form handlers and state management
   - ✅ Header layout: Title LEFT, "Lưu nháp" + "Xuất bản" buttons RIGHT

**Apple Components Integrated:**
- **AppleMetricCard**: Statistics display with trend indicators (up/down/neutral)
- **AppleTabs**: Consistent tab navigation with underline variant
- **AppleSearchBar**: Search functionality with icon
- **AppleInput**: Form text inputs with labels and validation
- **AppleSelect**: Dropdown selects with options array
- **AppleButton**: Buttons with variants (primary/secondary/danger)

**Compliance Achievement:**
- ✅ All 4 pages use mandatory container: `max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 mb-12`
- ✅ All 4 pages follow header layout: Title/description LEFT, 2 action buttons RIGHT
- ✅ Zero LSP/TypeScript errors after refactoring
- ✅ E2E tests passed: Design consistency verified, all components functional
- ✅ Admin compliance improved: **28% → 50%** (Phase A target achieved)

**Next Steps:**
- Phase B: Extend compliance to remaining admin pages (dashboard, campaigns, brands, KOC, analytics, financial, communication)
- Phase C: ESLint enforcement for design system usage
- Phase D: External reusability (npm package, documentation)
